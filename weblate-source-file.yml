Over_the_last_16_months_as_Ive_debated_this_issue_around_the_world_every_single_time_somebody_has__KEY: |
  Over the last 16 months, as I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, "I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide." I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, "Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide." <strong>Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.</strong>

The_primary_reason_for_window_curtains_in_our_house_is_to_stop_people_from_being_able_to_see_in._The_KEY: |
  The primary reason for window curtains in our house, is to stop people from being able to see in. The reason we don’t want them to see in is because we consider much of what we do inside our homes to be private. Whether that be having dinner at the table, watching a movie with your kids, or even engaging in intimate or sexual acts with your partner. None of these things are illegal by any means but even knowing this, we still keep the curtains and blinds on our windows. We clearly have this strong desire for privacy when it comes to our personal life and the public.

  The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything. With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. If I wanted to see your emails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your emails, passwords, phone records, credit cards. I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things... I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under.

Mandatory_a_hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiKey_disclosure_lawkey_disclosure_lawsa_require__KEY: |
  Mandatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law">key disclosure laws</a> require individuals to turn over encryption keys to law enforcement conducting a criminal investigation. How these laws are implemented (who may be legally compelled to assist) vary from nation to nation, but a warrant is generally required. Defenses against key disclosure laws include steganography and encrypting data in a way that provides plausible deniability.</p>  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">Steganography</a> involves hiding sensitive information (which may be encrypted) inside of ordinary data (for example, encrypting an image file and then hiding it in an audio file). With plausible deniability, data is encrypted in a way that prevents an adversary from being able to prove that the information they are after exists (for example, one password may decrypt benign data and another password, used on the same file, could decrypt sensitive data).

Services_based_in_the_United_States_are_not_recommended_because_of_the_countrys_surveillance_program_KEY: |
  Services based in the United States are not recommended because of the country's surveillance programs and use of <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters/faq">National Security Letters</a> (NSLs) with accompanying gag orders, which forbid the recipient from talking about the request. This combination allows the government to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/08/more_on_the_nsa.html">secretly force</a> companies to grant complete access to customer data and transform the service into a tool of mass surveillance.

An_example_of_this_is_a_hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiLavabitSuspension_and_gag_orderLavabi_KEY: |
  An example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit#Suspension_and_gag_order">Lavabit</a> – a secure email service created by Ladar Levison. The FBI <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/nzz888/lavabit-founder-ladar-levison-discusses-his-federal-battle-for-privacy">requested</a> Snowden's records after finding out that he used the service. Since Lavabit did not keep logs and email content was stored encrypted, the FBI served a subpoena (with a gag order) for the service's SSL keys. Having the SSL keys would allow them to access communications (both metadata and unencrypted content) in real time for all of Lavabit's customers, not just Snowden's.

  Ultimately, Levison turned over the SSL keys and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email">shut down</a> the service at the same time. The US government then <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/100962389">threatened Levison with arrest</a>, saying that shutting down the service was a violation of the court order.

A_VPN_is_pointless_if_it_cant_even_provide_adequate_security._We_require_all_our_recommended_provide_KEY: |
  A VPN is pointless if it can't even provide adequate security. We require all our recommended providers to abide by current security standards for their OpenVPN connections. Ideally, they would use more future-proof encryption schemes by default. We also require an independent third-party to audit the provider's security, ideally in a very comprehensive manner and on a repeated (yearly) basis.

Should_I_use_a_VPN?_KEY: |
  Should I use a VPN?

The_answer_to_this_question_is_not_a_particularly_helpful_one_strongIt_depends.strong_It_depend_KEY: |
  The answer to this question is not a particularly helpful one: <strong>It depends.</strong> It depends on what you're expecting a VPN to do for you, who you're trying to hide your traffic from, and what applications you're using.

strongIn_most_cases_VPNs_do_little_to_protect_your_privacy_or_enhance_your_securitystrong_unle_KEY: |
  <strong>In most cases, VPNs do little to protect your privacy or enhance your security</strong>, unless paired with other changes.

VPNs_cannot_encrypt_data_outside_of_the_connection_between_your_device_and_the_VPN_server._VPN_provid_KEY: |
  VPNs cannot encrypt data outside of the connection between your device and the VPN server. VPN providers can see and modify your traffic the same way your ISP could. And there is no way to verify a VPN provider's "no logging" policies in any way.

What_if_I_need_encryption?_KEY: |
  What if I need encryption?

In_most_cases_most_of_your_traffic_is_already_encrypted!_Over_98_of_the_top_3000_websites_offer_st_KEY: |
  In most cases, most of your traffic is already encrypted! Over 98% of the top 3000 websites offer <strong>HTTPS</strong>, meaning your non-DNS traffic is safe regardless of using a VPN. It is incredibly rare for applications that handle personal data to not support HTTPS in 2019, especially with services like Let's Encrypt offering free HTTPS certificates to any website operator.

Even_if_a_site_you_visit_doesnt_support_HTTPS_a_VPN_will_not_protect_you_because_a_VPN_cannot_magi_KEY: |
  Even if a site you visit doesn't support HTTPS, a VPN will not protect you, because a VPN cannot magically encrypt the traffic between the VPN's servers and the website's servers. Installing an extension like <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> and making sure every site you visit uses HTTPS is far more helpful than using a VPN.

Should_I_use_encrypted_DNS_with_a_VPN?_KEY: |
  Should I use encrypted DNS with a VPN?

The_answer_to_this_question_is_also_not_very_helpful_strongit_dependsstrong._Your_VPN_provider__KEY: |
  The answer to this question is also not very helpful: <strong>it depends</strong>. Your VPN provider may have their own DNS servers, but if they don't, the traffic between your VPN provider and the DNS server isn't encrypted. You need to trust the <a href="{{ '/providers/dns/#icanndns' | translate_page }}">encrypted DNS provider</a> in addition to the VPN provider and unless your client and target server support <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/esni-privacy-protecting-upgrade-https">encrypted SNI</a>, the VPN provider can still see which domains you are visiting.

However_strongyou_shouldnt_use_encrypted_DNS_with_Torstrong._This_would_direct_all_of_your_DNS__KEY: |
  However <strong>you shouldn't use encrypted DNS with Tor</strong>. This would direct all of your DNS requests through a single circuit, and would allow the encrypted DNS provider to deanonymize you.

What_if_I_need_anonymity?_KEY: |
  What if I need anonymity?

VPNs_cannot_provide_strong_anonymity._Your_VPN_provider_will_still_see_your_real_IP_address_and_ofte_KEY: |
  VPNs cannot provide strong anonymity. Your VPN provider will still see your real IP address, and often has a money trail that can be linked directly back to you. You cannot rely on "no logging" policies to protect your data.

Shouldnt_I_hide_my_IP_address?_KEY: |
  Shouldn't I hide my IP address?

The_idea_that_your_IP_address_is_sensitive_information_or_that_your_location_is_given_away_with_all__KEY: |
  The idea that your IP address is sensitive information, or that your location is given away with all your internet traffic is <strong>fearmongering</strong> on the part of VPN providers and their marketing. Your IP address is an insignificant amount of personal data tracking companies use to identify you, because many users' IP addresses change very frequently (Dynamic IP addresses, switching networks, switching devices, etc.). Your IP address also does not give away more than the very generalized location of your Internet Service Provider. It does not give away your home address, for example, despite common perception.

Should_I_use_Tor_emandem_a_VPN?_KEY: |
  Should I use Tor <em>and</em> a VPN?

By_using_a_VPN_with_Tor_youre_creating_essentially_a_permanent_entry_node_often_with_a_money_trail_KEY: |
  By using a VPN with Tor, you're creating essentially a permanent entry node, often with a money trail attached. This provides 0 additional benefit to you, while increasing the attack surface of your connection dramatically. If you wish to hide your Tor usage from your ISP or your government, Tor has a built-in solution for that: Tor bridges. <a href="https://write.privacytools.io/my-thoughts-on-security/slicing-onions-part-2-onion-recipes-vpn-not-required">Read more about Tor bridges and why using a VPN is not necessary</a>.

  A VPN may still be useful to you in a variety of scenarios, such as:

Hiding_your_traffic_from_strongonlystrong_your_Internet_Service_Provider._KEY: |
  Hiding your traffic from <strong>only</strong> your Internet Service Provider.

Hiding_your_downloads_such_as_torrents_from_your_ISP_and_antipiracy_organizations._KEY: |
  Hiding your downloads (such as torrents) from your ISP and anti-piracy organizations.

  For use cases like these, or if you have another compelling reason, the VPN providers we listed above are who we think are the most trustworthy. However, using a VPN provider still means you're <em>trusting</em> the provider. In pretty much any other scenario you should be using a secure<strong>-by-design</strong> tool such as Tor.
